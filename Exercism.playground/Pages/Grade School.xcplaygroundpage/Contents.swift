# Grade School

Write a small archiving program that stores students' names along with the grade that they are in.

In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
- "Add Jim to grade 2."
- "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
- "Which students are in grade 2?"
- "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  Grades should sort
as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted
alphabetically by name.
- "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
- "Grade 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Grade 2: Alex, Peter, and Zoe.
Grade 3â€¦"

Note that all our students only have one name.  (It's a small town, what
do you want?)


## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

- If your implementation allows outside code to mutate the school's
internal DB directly, see if you can prevent this. Feel free to
introduce additional tests.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?
