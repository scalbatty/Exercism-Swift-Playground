# Exercism Swift Playground

Here are the solutions I've made for some Exercism problems. If you don't know what [Exercism](http://exercism.io) is, you should definitely check it out : it's a coding exercise platform, built around community and feedback, it supports many many languages.

These are solutions to some exercises from this website, in the order they are presented. Some of them I've solved long ago when I was just learning the language, some I've solved pretty recently.

You should **not** be looking at my solutions if you plan on solving these exercises. They are pretty easy to understand, and solving them by yourself is exactly the point!

This Playground is multi-page, each page is its own exercise. On each page you'll find the exercise orders, my implementation then the unit tests. The last bit is the boilerplate to run XCTest inside each Playground page, which you can find [on sshrpe's Github Repository](https://github.com/sshrpe/TDDSwiftPlayground) (explanations on [his blog post](http://initwithstyle.net/2015/11/tdd-in-swift-playgrounds/).) Thanks to him for this!

Enjoy
